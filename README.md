Duration: June 20,2024 to July 20th 2024
Mentor: Neela Santosh Kumar

# Objectives
The objective is to utilize the Wokwi software to effectively monitor weather conditions by accurately calculating temperature and humidity. This includes creating a reliable virtual weather station that can provide precise and real-time data for these parameters. The aim is to enhance weather prediction and analysis by leveraging the capabilities of Wokwi.

# Key Activities
Sensor Integration: Use sensors like DHT22 for temperature and humidity, BMP180 for barometric pressure, and rain sensors.
Data Logging: Implement data logging to an SD card or cloud storage for historical weather data analysis.
Real-Time Display: Display real-time data on an LCD screen or through a web interface.
Alerts: Set up alerts for specific weather conditions, like high temperatures or heavy rainfall.
Power Management: Optimize power usage for remote deployments, potentially using solar power and battery backups.

# Technologies Used
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32): The central unit that processes sensor data and controls other components.
Sensors:
Temperature and Humidity Sensor (e.g., DHT22, SHT31): Measures ambient temperature and humidity levels.
Pressure Sensor (e.g., BMP280, BME280): Captures atmospheric pressure readings.
Rain Gauge: Monitors rainfall.
Wind Speed and Direction Sensor: Measures wind speed and direction.
Display (e.g., OLED, LCD): Shows real-time weather data.
Communication Modules (e.g., Wi-Fi, LoRa, GSM): Enables remote data transmission and monitoring.
Power Supply (e.g., Battery, Solar Panel): Provides the necessary power for continuous operation.
